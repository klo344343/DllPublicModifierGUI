# Key Features
1. Comprehensive Access Analysis
Scans DLLs for all restricted members:

- Fields: Identifies private/internal fields

- Methods: Detects private/internal methods

- Classes/Types: Finds non-public, nested private, and nested internal classes

2. Three-Tab Interface
- Fields Tab: Lists all restricted fields with their current access modifiers

- Methods Tab: Displays all restricted methods with access details

- Classes Tab: Shows all non-public classes and types

3. Smart Modification Capabilities
- Converts access modifiers to public for:

- Fields (private → public, internal → public)

- Methods (private → public, internal → public)

- Classes (nested private → nested public, internal → public)

4. Detailed Reporting
- Provides modification statistics:

- Number of classes/types modified

- Number of fields changed

- Number of methods updated

- Preserves original DLL while creating modified version with "modified_" prefix

5. User-Friendly Operation
- Simple file selection dialog

- Automatic creation of "Public_dll" folder on desktop for output

- Clear status messages and progress indicators

- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

# Technical Specifications
Platform: .NET Framework Windows Forms application

Dependencies: Mono.Cecil library for assembly manipulation

Output: Generates modified DLL with public access members

Compatibility: Works with most .NET assemblies (including nested types)

# Usage Scenarios
Debugging and testing (accessing internal members)

Legacy code modification

Educational purposes (analyzing assembly structure)

Library development and interoperability

Safety Features
Never modifies the original DLL file

Creates backups automatically

Validates DLL structure before modification

Provides clear warnings and error messages

# This tool is particularly useful for developers needing to access restricted members in third-party libraries or legacy code, while maintaining a simple and intuitive interface.
